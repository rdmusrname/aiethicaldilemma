Market segmentation the process of dividing a broad consumer base into smaller more  homogeneous groups based on shared characteristics has long  been a valuable tool for businesses  seeking to  tailor their marketing efforts and deliver personalized experiences. However, traditional  approaches to market segmentation often rely on  demographic and  psychographic data, which may overlook the dynamic and evolving nature of  consumer behavior.
